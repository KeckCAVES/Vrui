<TR>
<TD>enableMultipipe</TD><TD><A HREF="#boolean">boolean</A></TD>
<TD>Master toggle for cluster-based multipipe rendering. If true, Vrui will read the following multipipe... settings and configure itself to run in a distributed environment where applications are replicated across cluster nodes and synchronized by sharing input device data and application-specific data streams. <EM>This is not the appropriate rendering mode for single-system-image multipipe architectures (such as SGI Onyx/Prism).</EM></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>multipipeMaster</TD><TD><A HREF="#string">string</A></TD>
<TD>Internet host name or dotted-form IP address of the master node in a distributed rendering environment. The master node is the one where users log in and start Vrui applications. Some Vrui settings rely on node indices; the index of the master node is always zero.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>multipipeMasterPort</TD><TD><A HREF="#integer">integer</A></TD>
<TD>Number of the UDP port used for cluster communication on the master node. This port needs to be accessible from the slave nodes, i.e., it must be accepted by any installed firewalls.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>multipipeSlaves</TD><TD><A HREF="#list">list</A> of <A HREF="#string">strings</A></TD>
<TD>List of the internet host names or dotted-form IP addresses of the slave nodes in a distributed rendering environment. A Vrui application started on the master node will replicate itself onto these slave nodes using the <EM>multipipeRemoteCommand</EM>. Some Vrui settings rely on node indices; slave nodes are numbered in the order in which they appear in the list, starting at one.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>multipipeMulticastGroup</TD><TD><A HREF="#string">string</A></TD>
<TD>Internet name or dotted-form IP address of the multicast or broadcast address used for communication from the master node to the slave nodes. Vrui uses a multicast protocol if the given address is a valid IETF multicast address, and uses a broadcast protocol otherwise. All nodes in the cluster must be able to receive UDP packets sent to the multicast/broadcast address.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>multipipeMulticastPort</TD><TD><A HREF="#integer">integer</A></TD>
<TD>Number of the UDP port used for cluster communication on the slave nodes. This port needs to be accessible from the master node, i.e., it must be accepted by any installed firewalls.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>multipipeRemoteCommand</TD><TD><A HREF="#string">string</A></TD>
<TD>Command used to log in to slave nodes during Vrui application startup. If not specified, this defaults to <EM>ssh</EM>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>multipipeConnectionWaitTimeout</TD><TD><A HREF="#number">number</A></TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>multipipePingTimeout</TD><TD><A HREF="#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>Timeout value for cluster crash detection. If a slave node does not receive data from the master for the specified time (in seconds), it sends a ping request to the master. If too many ping requests time out (see next setting), the slave node exits from Vrui.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>multipipePingRetries</TD><TD><A HREF="#integer">integer</A></TD>
<TD>Maximum number of ping requests sent by a slave node before it exits from Vrui (see previous setting).</TD>
</TR>

<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>inchScale</TD><TD><A HREF="#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the physical coordinate unit used to describe the Vrui environment by specifying the length of an inch in physical units. For example, if the used physical units are meters, <EM>inchScale</EM> is set to 0.0254.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>meterScale</TD><TD><A HREF="#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the physical coordinate unit used to describe the Vrui environment by specifying the length of a meter in physical units. Alternative to <EM>inchScale</EM> setting, see above. For example, if the used physical units are centimeters, <EM>meterScale</EM> is set to 100.0.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>displayCenter</TD><TD><A HREF="#point">point</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the center point of the Vrui display environment in physical coordinates. The center point is mostly used by applications to initialize their model coordinates. In general, the display center should be a point that is in the middle of the display space accessible by users, such as the screen center for a single-screen environment or the center point of a CAVE.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>displaySize</TD><TD><A HREF="#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>Defines an approximate size for the Vrui display environment in physical coordinate units. The display size is mostly used by applications to initialize their model coordinates.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>forwardDirection</TD><TD><A HREF="#vector">vector</A></TD>
<TD>Defines a direction vector in physical coordinates that corresponds to the typical direction a user would face when looking at a Vrui display environment. For single-screen environments it is typically a vector pointing into the screen; in CAVEs, it is typically a vector pointing into the back wall.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>upDirection</TD><TD><A HREF="#vector">vector</A></TD>
<TD>Defines a direction vector in physical coordinates that corresponds to &quot;up,&quot; i.e., the opposite direction of local gravity. It is mostly used by Vrui application to initialize their model coordinates such that models appear right side up.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>floorPlane</TD><TD><A HREF="#plane">plane</A></TD>
<TD>Defines a plane in physical coordinates that corresponds to a Vrui display environment's floor. For walk-in environments such as CAVEs or upright display walls it is typically the true floor plane; for desktop-like environments it is typically a plane orthogonal to the &quot;up&quot; direction that is placed a few feet below the screen center.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>glyphSize</TD><TD><A HREF="#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>Specifies the display size of glyphs such as input device pointers in physical coordinates.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>newInputDevicePosition</TD><TD><A HREF="#point">point</A></TD>
<TD>Specifies a point in physical coordinates that is used as the initial position for newly created virtual input devices. It is typically identical to the display center, but for single-screen environments, it is typically offset a few inches to be placed in front of the screen to simplify interaction with new virtual input devices.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>inputDeviceAdapterNames</TD><TD><A HREF="#list">list</A> of <A HREF="#string">strings</A></TD>
<TD>List of names of the <A HREF="#inputdeviceadaptersections">input device adapter sections</A> that specify all sources of user input recognized by Vrui applications.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>inputDeviceDataSaver</TD><TD><A HREF="#string">string</A></TD>
<TD>Name of <A HREF="#inputdevicedatasaversection">input device data saver section</A>. If this is a valid section name, Vrui will save the state of all physical input devices to a file on every frame. These files can later be played back by creating a playback input device adapter. Saving input device data can be useful during debugging, to capture a session and play it back later from inside a debugger, or to generate 3D movies of someone using a Vrui application.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>updateContinuously</TD><TD><A HREF="#boolean">boolean</A></TD>
<TD>Flag whether to run Vrui's inner loop continuously. If this is set to false, Vrui will only update its (and the application's state) whenever new data arrives from any input devices. This is the most appropriate mode for non-immersive display environments. If set to true, Vrui will update its internal state as fast as possible, regardless of whether new input device data arrived or not. Applications that use animation will typically override this setting to run smooth animations even if no input device events arrive.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>maximumFrameRate</TD><TD><A HREF="#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>The maximum allowed frame rate for Vrui's main loop. If this parameter is set to a value larger than zero, the Vrui main loop will pad each frame to at least the duration of 1.0/maximFrameRate seconds by blocking before advancing to the next frame. Normally Vrui applications should run as fast as they can to minimize latency; however, some special uses like generating 3D movies by saving input device data (see above) might benefit from a throttled frame rate.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>viewerNames</TD><TD><A HREF="#list">list</A> of <A HREF="#string">strings</A></TD>
<TD>List of names of <A HREF="#viewersections">viewer sections</A>. Viewers define how 3D models are projected onto a Vrui display environment's <EM>screens</EM>. The first viewer in the list is considered the <EM>main viewer</EM> and is treated specially, for example, is used to determine the orientation of pop-up menus.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>screenNames</TD><TD><A HREF="#list">list</A> of <A HREF="#string">strings</A></TD>
<TD>List of names of <A HREF="#screensections">screen sections</A>. Together with <EM>viewers</EM>, screens define how 3D models are projected in a Vrui display environment.</TD>
</TR>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD>node&lt;<EM>index</EM>&gt;WindowNames<BR>windowNames</TD><TD><A HREF="#list">list</A> of <A HREF="#string">strings</A></TD>
<TD>List of names of <A HREF="#windowsections">window sections</A>. Windows are the &quot;glue&quot; that bind <EM>viewers</EM> to <EM>screens</EM> and implement the OpenGL-based 3D rendering used by Vrui. In cluster-based distributed display environments, there must be a <EM>node&lt;index&gt;WindowNames</EM> tag for each cluster node (the master node is always zero; slave nodes are numbered according to their order in the <EM>multipipeSlaves</EM> list, starting at one. Any nodes with empty window lists will not open any windows, but otherwise fully participate in the Vrui application. This is useful for cluster head nodes with low-powered graphics cards, or for dedicated audio rendering nodes.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>node&lt;<EM>index</EM>&gt;WindowsMultithreaded<BR>windowsMultithreaded</TD><TD><A HREF="#boolean">boolean</A></TD>
<TD>Toggles between serial and parallel rendering for multiple windows on the same computer. If any Vrui node has multiple windows and this setting is true, Vrui will use multiple threads, one per window, to render to the windows in parallel. The default mode, if this setting is false, is to render to the windows serially from a single thread. The appropriate mode for single-system-image multipipe systems such as SGI Onyx or Prism is to configure them as a non-distributed environment (<EM>enableMultipipe</EM> is false), assign one window to each graphics pipe, and render to these windows in parallel. However, if a node has multiple windows but only a single actual graphics card, it is usually better to render in serial since graphics cards are typically not optimized for rapid context switches.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>node&lt;<EM>index</EM>&gt;SoundDeviceName<BR>soundDeviceName</TD><TD><A HREF="#string">string</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the name of a sound device to use for the given Vrui node. If no sound device name is defined for a node, audio (using OpenAL) will be disabled for that node.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>frontplaneDist</TD><TD><A HREF="#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the distance in physical units of the OpenGL front clipping plane from the eye points of Vrui viewers. This defines how closely a viewer can approach 3D objects before the objects are clipped away.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>backplaneDist</TD><TD><A HREF="#number">number</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the distance in physical units of the OpenGL back clipping plane from the eye points of Vrui viewers. This defines how far a 3D object can move into the distance before it is clipped away.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>backgroundColor</TD><TD><A HREF="#color">color</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the background color used for all windows in a Vrui display environment, unless overridden by Vrui applications.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>ambientLightColor</TD><TD><A HREF="#color">color</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the ambient color component used in the OpenGL lighting equation. This is the light color used when no other lights are present. It should be kept at fairly low values not to wash out display contrast.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>widgetMaterial</TD><TD><A HREF="#material">material</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the material properties of 3D GUI widgets such as pop-up menus, dialog windows, etc.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>drawOverlayWidgets</TD><TD><A HREF="#boolean">boolean</A></TD>
<TD>Switches whether 3D user interface widgets are drawn in an overlay layer above all other 3D graphics. If disabled (the default), 3D widgets are integrated with other 3D graphics and drawn at the proper depth. If enabled, widgets are still drawn at proper depth, but appear to float above other graphics. This makes the user interface more desktop-like and works well in non-stereo mode, but can cause severe eye strain in stereo modes on the desktop and especially in immersive environments.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>popWidgetsOnScreen</TD><TD><A HREF="#boolean">boolean</A></TD>
<TD>If set to true, widgets popped up by Vrui applications will always be aligned with the main screen's plane, unless the application specifies a full widget transformation. This helps with keeping the illusion of a 2D user interface in desktop environemnts. This flag should not be enabled for immersive environments.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>uiSize</TD><TD><A HREF="#number">number</A></TD>

<TR>
<TD>buttonKeys</TD><TD><A HREF="#list">list</A> of <A HREF="#keyname">key names</A></TD>
<TD>Lists a subset of keyboard keys that are treated just like mouse buttons by the mouse input device adapter. The total number of buttons in each button plane (see <EM>modifierKeys</EM> setting) is the number of button keys plus the number of actual mouse buttons (see the <EM>numButtons</EM> setting).</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>modifierKeys</TD><TD><A HREF="#list">list</A> of <A HREF="#keyname">key names</A></TD>
<TD>Lists the set of modifier keys recognized by the Vrui mouse input device adapter. Modifier keys (and combinations thereof) allow access to several button planes to increase the total number of available buttons. For example, if LeftCtrl and LeftAlt are listed as modifier keys, Vrui will create four button planes (no modifier, LeftCtrl only, LeftAlt only, LeftCtrl+LeftAlt). Buttons are numbered sequentially inside each plane by mouse buttons first and then button keys, and then in order of planes. Planes are ordered according to modifier button combinations in LSB-first binary code. The plane with no modifiers pressed is always zero, and in the preceding example, the (LeftCtrl only) plane is 1, and the (LeftCtrl+LeftAlt) plane is 3.<BR>
<B>Note</B>: Any buttons (mouse buttons and/or button keys) that are pressed while the button plane is changed stay pressed until their button plane is selected again. This can be very useful especially in desktop-like environments.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>numButtons</TD><TD><A HREF="#integer">integer</A></TD>
<TD>Defines the number of buttons on the actual mouse device as reported by the windowing system. Is typically 3 in X11-based systems. The total number of buttons in each button plane (see <EM>modifierKeys</EM> setting) is the number of button keys (see the <EM>buttonKeys</EM> setting) plus the number of actual mouse buttons.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>fakeMouseCursor</TD><TD><A HREF="#boolean">boolean</A></TD>
<TD>Enables a texture-based mouse cursor to be rendered at the position of the mouse input device controlled by the input device adapter.

<TR>
<TD>mouseCursorNominalSize</TD><TD><A HREF="#integer">integer</A></TD>
<TD>The nominal size of the mouse cursor which is to be loaded from the cursor image file. Nominal sizes are defined in the cursor file itself, and Vrui selects the most closely matching size from the file.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mouseCursorSize</TD><TD><A HREF="#size">size</A></TD>
<TD>Size of the rendered mouse cursor glyph in physical coordinates. The third component of the given value is ignored.</TD>
