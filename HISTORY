  device by a fixed vector and replicate one device button to the offset
  device.

Vrui-1.0-032:
- Changed build system and some sources to provide preliminary support
  for Mac OS X.
  - Requires OS version 10.4.
  - Requires X11 emulation.
  - Can be configured to use Apple's OpenAL package.
  - Can be configured to use libpng for PNG image file support and
    libjpeg for JPEG image file support.
- Removed plug-in handling from Misc library and moved it to Plugins
  library to remove dependency of Misc on libdl.
  - Factory and FactoryManager moved from namespace Misc to namespace
    Plugins.

Vrui-1.0-033:
- Changed behavior of Vrui windows to provide a consistent window into
  the virtual world by panning their viewports across the maximum
  viewport defined by the display containing the window.
  - Still need to fix MouseNavigationTool such that it rotates/scales
    around the current window center instead of the display center.
  - Should change panning behavior to move a VRScreen inside the bounds
    of the screen given in the configuration file instead of moving the
    window inside the screen -- will simplify integrating moving windows
    with other parts of Vrui.
- Changed behavior of modifier keys inside InputDeviceAdapterMouse such
  that buttons and button keys are "sticky" when changing the current
  button set with a modifier key.
- Added navigation/virtual device tool to better integrate SpaceBall
  input devices into Vrui.
  - Should implement generic HIDNavigationTool to convert valuators into
    arbitrary translational/rotational axes.

Vrui-1.0-039:
- Fixed typo in error message strings for Threads::Thread exception
  classes.

  reliably send large amounts of data across the broadcast/multicast
  connection. Throughput for 100Mb/s Ethernet is stable at 11.34MB/s,
  throughput for 1Gb/s Ethernet is fluctuating up to 91.4MB/s.
- Changed SpaceBallNavigationTool to additionally allow zooming.
- Changed build system to allow per-package compiler flags.
- Improved desktop embedding:
  - Windows in panningViewport can be configured to keep the tool kill
    zone in a fixed user-specified position when moved/resized.
  - Windows in panningViewport moved can be configured to move the 3D
    scene along with them.
  - Mouse navigation in panningViewport windows zooms around the window
    center and dollys in a line from the eye to the window center
- Changed API of Vrui::ToolManager and Vrui::ToolKillZone.
- Added function to Vrui.h to concatenate navigation transformations
  from the left.
- Added function to Vrui.h to detect whether the local node is the

- Added library interdependencies to makefile to allow parallel build
  using make -j <numjobs>.
- Added required environment variable for Mac OS X builds to Vrui
  makefile fragment.
- Fixed bug in Comm::MulticastPipeMultiplexer causing a segmentation
  fault when slaves are waiting on an empty send queue.

  transforming a "from" vector into a "to" vector.
- Added ValueCoder class for class Plane to geometry library.
- Added forward direction to Vrui environment state to help applications
  that need a general direction pointing "into" the VR environment. Can
  be queried using the Vrui::getForwardDirection() function.
- Added floor plane equation to Vrui environment state to help
  applications that want to have a user walk on a virtual environment,
  for example. Can be queried using the Vrui::getFloorPlane() function.
- Added WalkNavigationTool class to navigate immersive VR environments
  by walking and gaze direction.
- Added accessor methods to Vrui::Glyph.
- Added generic waldo tool to scale translations and rotations of 6-DOF
  input devices (generalization of WaldoLocatorTool and

  counting to Misc library (classes RefCounted and Autopointer), and
  a thread-safe version of RefCounted class to Threads library.
- Added code to Vrui.General.cpp to re-normalize navigation
  transformation on every set... and concatenate... call.
- Fixed a leftover bug in Misc::MulticastPipeMultiplexer that prohibited
  opening/closing pipes dynamically and broadcasting high-bandwidth bulk
  data. Multicast pipes now get average transfer rates of about 70MB/s
  on 1Gb/s Ethernet, and are reliable to use for application-level data
  streaming.
- Added shift() method to Geometry::Box to shift boxes by a given offset
  vector.
- Fixed synchronization bug in Vrui: application time was only
  synchronized after the first complete frame.
- Added isJoined() method to Threads::Thread.
- Added Vrui::Rotation class to Vrui/Geometry.h, to create a shortcut
  when writing rotation code.
- Added Misc/Utility.h header file containing basic helper functions.
- Improved Geometry::Polygon class. Now has robust point-in-polygon test
  for 2- and 3-dimensional general polygons.
- Improved Comm::TCPSocket class (reduced latency/increased through-put)
  by adding methods to enable/disable TCP_NODELAY or TCP_CORK. TCP_CORK
  momentarily only supported by Linux kernels >= 2.4.
- Added configuration file setting to specify the UDP port to use on a
  multicast master, to simplify getting through firewalls. Still
  defaults to dynamic port assignment by the OS.
- Changed Vislet API to allow vislet classes to read default settings
  from the Vislet manager's section in the Vrui configuration file.
  - CAVERenderer vislet class now reads texture file names and
    rendering settings from configuration file; can still be overridden
    by command line parameters.
  - Added Vrui::getVisletManager(void) function to Vrui kernel
    interface in Vrui/Vrui.h.
- Added shutdown method to Comm::TCPSocket to selectively close the
  read or write direction of a connected socket.
- Slightly changed error handling in Comm::TCPSocket blocking read and
  write to more reliably detect unexpected socket closures.
- Fixed Mac OS X version of HIDDevice input device driver module by
  filtering out non-axis device capabilities (fix by Braden Pellett).
- Added clarification comment about Vrui::openPipe() returning NULL in
  non-cluster environments to Vrui/Vrui.h
- Added header file Vrui/ClusterSupport.h with helper functions to
  simplify writing cluster-aware applications.
- Finally fixed Vrui::WaldoTool to behave as expected.
- Fixed access privilege bug in converting copy constructor of
  Geometry::AffineTransformation.
- Fixed several bugs in Comm::MulticastPipeMultiplexer, but still not
  working reliably.
- Changed Vrui's shutdown behavior. Previous implementation destroyed
  Vrui state before an application object's destructor was called,
  leading to persistent crashes on shutdown. New approach has explicit
  deinit() function. This change is transparent to applications using
  the application object interface.
- Changed Vrui's internal cluster communication protocol to flush the
  internal multicast pipe as early in the frame as possible to increase
  parallelism between the master and the slaves.
- Added "multipipeRemoteCommand" setting to Vrui configuration file to
  select the command used to start slave application instances
  (defaults to "ssh").
- Changed order of Vrui state elements and initialization from
  configuration file. Now properly reads physical unit size before
  reading other sizes depending on it.
- Supported more key names in Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterMouse. Now
  covering most keys on standard keyboards.
- Added a reference page listing all settings in the Vrui
  configuration file to the HTML documentation.
- Enabled spinning animation for Vrui::MouseNavigationTool.
- Added Comm::ClusterPipe abstraction for transparent TCP communication
  between clusters connected via Comm::MulticastPipeMultiplexer.
- Changed Comm::TCPSocket to optionally fall back to returning dotted
  addresses if the peer's host name cannot be resolved instead of
  throwing an exception. Default behavior is still to throw.
- Finished implementing behavior of Vrui::VRWindow for desktop
  environments where panningViewport and navigate are enabled.
  Navigation coordinates scale with the window size, and Vrui's display
  center and size are updated such that applications can center their
  displays properly.
- Added input device adapter to support the (proprietary) head tracker
  on VisBox and VisWall immersive environments.
- Added Vrui::ButtonInputDeviceTool to manipulate virtual 6-DOF input
  devices using keyboard keys or other buttons.
- Added Vrui::ToolKillZoneFrustum to simplify deleting tools in a
  desktop environment.
- Added facility to draw fake mouse cursors to
  Vrui::MouseNavigationTool.
- Replaced Images::RBGImage class with a templatized base class
  Images::Image and specialized derived classes for RGB and RGBA images.
- Added function to read Xcursor cursor files in Images/ReadImageFile.h.
- Added missing template instantiation of value coder class for
  Geometry::ComponentArray to Geometry/GeometryValueCoders.
- Fixed crash in Images::readImageFile when reading a PNG image with
  alpha channel into an RGB image.

Vrui-1.0-042:
- Extended use of GLMotif::StyleSheet to assign default attributes
  during widget creation. Deprecated widget constructors that expect
  certain attributes (such as fonts) as arguments; all initialization
  now done through the widget manager's style sheet.
- Added GLMotif::SubMenu class to more elegantly handle cascading pop-
  up menus.
- API change in GLMotif::StyleSheet: public element sliderWidth is now
  called sliderHandleWidth. Client code should stop using the now
  deprecated method passing sliderWidth into the GLMotif::Slider
  constructor and use the new constructor instead.
- Added convenience method to add new toggle buttons to
  GLMotif::RadioBox and finished interface to completely handle radio
  buttons using indices.
- Added Vrui::TransparentObject as a base class for objects that need
  a second rendering pass to render transparency. Transparency pass is
  called in physical coordinates, with alpha blending enabled and the
  depth buffer locked, after the application's display function.
- Added per-chunk functor applicator to class Misc::ChunkedArray.
- Fixed shutdown behavior in Vrui; closes VR windows and destroys
  context data items before returning from the main loop.
- Fixed layout bug in GLMotif::Slider: calcZRange method used sliderbox
  and shaftbox before they were properly initialized.
- Fixed wrong setting names for Frustum tool kill zones in Vrui
  configuration file.

Vrui-1.0-043:
- Added Images/GetImageFileSize containing a function to read the size
  of an image file without having to read the entire image.

  when compiling with -pedantic to Plugins/FactoryManager and
  VRDeviceDaemon/VRFactory.cpp.
- Moved all Vrui tool plug-ins to Vrui/Tools directory.
- Fixed problem when trying to exit a window-less Vrui application
  instance; now prints note and exits on ESC (or any other) key.
- Redesigned Vrui cluster startup process to send the application's
  command line via a multicast pipe instead of the remote login
  command's command line to get around command line length limitations
  and double-globbing.
- Added simple timeout mechanism to Comm::MulticastPipeMultiplexer to
  detect communication failures or master node crashes from the slaves
  (to shut them down reliably in case of cluster failure).
- Added spinThreshold setting to Vrui::MouseNavigationTool. Spinning
  animation is only enabled if the mouse moved by more than the given
  threshold on the screen, measured in physical coordinate units.
- Added invertDolly flag to Vrui::MouseNavigationTool to invert the
  switch between dolly and zoom mode for those who are so inclined.
- Added extension class for the GL_EXT_framebuffer_object OpenGL
  extension.

  blocks of memory or memory-mapped files.
- Added Comm::TCPPipe to provide an endianness-safe pipe abstraction
  over TCP sockets.
- Fixed missing endianness conversion in std::string read/write methods
  in Comm::ClusterPipe.
- Added glCompileShaderFromFile() convenience function to
  GLARBShaderObjects extension class.
- Changed API of Comm::TCPPipe to allow explicit specification of
  network endianness during construction.
- Fixed bug in wrong endianness conversion in Comm::TCPPipe's write()
  methods.
- Added VR device driver for Vicon Tarsus optical tracking system.

  interpolation and clamps against image borders.
- Added getAddress() and getHostname() methods to Comm::TCPSocket to
  retrieve the dotted IP address and resolved host name of the local
  socket.
- Added mutex to Vrui state to protect asynchronous calls to
  Vrui::requestUpdate from multiple background threads.
- Added GL/GLShader, a convenience class for simple GLSL shaders
  compiling any number of vertex and fragment shaders into a single
  program object.
- Changed implementation of Vrui::VRWindow to pass eye position into
  private render function instead of eye index; API unchanged.
- Added Autostereoscopic rendering capability to Vrui::VRWindow.

Vrui-1.0-046:
- Fixed include file names in Geometry/Cone.h; was obviously never used
  or compiled.
- Added missing include file to GL/Extensions/GLARBVertexShader.h

Vrui-1.0-047:
- Added automatic detection of compiler version (works for gcc/g++) to
  BuildRoot/SystemDefinitions. Sets proper values for COMPILERTYPE and
  DEPFILETEMPLATE, and adds -ffriend-injection compiler flag for gcc
  versions 4.1.0 and up.
- Fixed Vrui::InputDeviceDataSaver, did not store number of input
  devices.
- Added value coder method for Geometry::OrthogonalTransformation to
  Geometry/GeometryValueCoders.h.
- Changed transform calibrator in VR device daemon to use orthogonal
  transformations to allow coordinate scale transformations.

Vrui-1.0-048:
- Removed definitions of __LITTLE_ENDIAN and __BIG_ENDIAN from the
  compiler command lines and from BuildRoot/SystemDefinitions and
  BuildRoot/BasicMakefile. Now uses endian.h header files found on Linux
  and Mac OS X. This affects all applications that directly query the
  value of the endianness #define macros.
- Added short-valued GLColor class and conversion operators from/to
  short-valued colors to standard instantiations.
- Created new tool base class for transforming tools (offset tool, waldo
  tool) to Vrui tool hierarchy.
- Added clutch tool that does not affect the controlled device's
  transformation while a clutch button is pressed.
- Added Misc::FileLocator, a helper class to find files based on a list
  of search paths. Contains methods to construct search paths for
  Mac OS X application bundles (and implies bundle structure for Linux
  applications).
- Added missing include file GL/GLVertexArrayTemplates.h to
  GL/GLGeometryWrappers.h.
- Fixed wrong comment in Vrui/Tools/MouseNavigationTool.h.
- Removed extra forward declaration from Vrui/Tools/MeasurementTool.h.
- Added option of multiple DSO search paths to Misc::FactoryManager by
  using a Misc::FileLocator. Constructor splits DSO name template into
  base directory and name template, and initializes the FileLocator with
  the base directory.
- Added multiple search paths to Vrui tool manager and vislet manager.
  The tool manager reads an optional "toolSearchPaths" setting from the
  configuration file and adds all directories to the search list after
  the default directory parsed from the tool DSO name template; the
  vislet manager does the same by reading a "visletSearchPaths" setting.
- API change in Vrui kernel: Vrui::setMainMenu now takes a pointer to
  GLMotif::PopupMenu instead of GLMotif::Widget. Should not cause
  problems with existing applications, since all are supposed to use
  PopupMenus as their main menu shells anyways.
- Added "Vrui System Menu" that is either installed as the main menu, or
  automatically added as a submenu to any application-provided main
  menus. Vrui system menu content currently functionless; will be filled
  in later.
- Fixed missing virtual destructor declaration in
  Misc::HashTable::EntryNotFoundError; caused problem when declaring
  hash tables from std::string due to wrong throw() specification.
- Changed API of Geometry::SplineCurve: Now has constructor that
  automatically creates appropriate knot vectors.
- Fixed bug in Images::Image::resize method; would not actually write
  resized image data.
- Removed superfluous include file Images/RGBImage.h from
  Vrui/Tools/MouseNavigationTool.cpp.
- Added new "newbie-friendly" mouse navigation tool to Vrui tools. It
  uses a single button on a mouse and a dialog box to switch navigation
  modes between rotating, panning, dollying, and scaling. The tool's
  configuration file settings are mostly identical to those of the old
  MouseNavigationTool.
- Some updates to Vrui HTML documentation.
- Added OpenGL extension class for GL_EXT_texture_cube_map.
- Added OpenGL extension class for GL_ARB_texture_compression.

  C^2-continuous cubic splines.
- Modified ViewpointFileNavigationTool to read viewpoint animations as
  written by CurveEditorTool.
- Fixed bug in GLMotif::Slider when slider's value increment is 0.
- Added Vrui::getMainPipe() method to Vrui kernel API; returned pipe is
  for simple synchronous cluster communication inside an application's
  (or a tool's) frame method; user must call finishMessage() when done.
- Added safeguard to Vrui main frame method to call finishMessage() on
  Vrui's main pipe in case an application forgets to do so.
- Changed Vrui.cfg to reflect most recent settings.

  makefile fragment to allow client application to find plug-in DSOs
  for pre-linking.
- Added Misc::SelfDestructPointer, a simple class for self-deleting
  pointers in cases where Misc::Autopointer's functionality is not
  required.
- Added autoScreenSize flag to Vrui::VRWindow initialization; if set to
  true, determines physical monitor size via X11 and adjusts the
  configured size of the window's associated VR screen(s).
- Changed Vrui.cfg file to automatically detect screen size.
- Reordered user interface in Vrui::CurveEditorTool.

  its widget pointer.
- Replicated GLMotif::Menu's API to GLMotif::SubMenu.
- Added option to draw GLMotif widgets in an overlay layer on top of
  other 3D graphics. Option is enabled by setting drawOverlayWidgets
  option to true in the widget section in Vrui's configuration file.
- Improved build system: Can now find libraries in a list of base
  directories by searching for header and dynamic library files.
  Currently only works if library headers and DSOs are installed under
  a common base directory. Added autosearch facility for packages PNG,
  JPEG, and OPENAL.
- Make variables to include support for PNG, JPEG, and OpenAL in Vrui
  applications now depend on automatic search results; should work in
  all realistic cases.
- Fixed bug in VRMeshEditor example application; now looks for Vrui tool
  headers in proper directory.
- Added entries to create and destroy virtual input devices to Vrui
  system menu.
- Added widget interaction capability to MouseNavigationTool as an evil
  hack until a better tool chaining model comes along.
- Disabled widget interaction capability in menu tools in Vrui.cfg.
- Changed default binding for MouseNavigationTool to use the "z" key for
  panning and zooming/dollying instead of the middle mouse button, to
  make it work out-of-the-box for those MacOS X users who do not have a
  working middle mouse button. Added remark in configuration file on how
  to enable the middle mouse button.
- Added "popWidgetsOnScreen" flag to Vrui configuration file to always
  align primary widgets with the screen plane, improving display in
  desktop environments.
- Added documentation page on how to configure desktop input devices
  like joysticks or spaceballs for use with Vrui applications.

- Fixed bugs in Vrui::InputDeviceDataSaver and
  Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterPlayback. InputDeviceDataSaver now writes to
  unique numbered file on each execution.
- Changed key handling in Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterMouse and
  Vrui::VRWindow to ignore modifier keys for key mapping, i.e., using
  modifier keys as Vrui modifier keys now has the intended effect.
- Ported automated library finder from csh to bash; csh not installed by
  default on newer systems.
- Fixed library finder invocation in BuildRoot/Packages; used to rely on
  "." being in the user's path. Now uses full path name based on
  $PACKAGEROOT.
- Added Vrui-wide command line parameter -loadView <viewpointFile> to
  load viewpoint files in the format as saved by the Vrui system menu.
  Viewpoint files are loaded at the beginning of the startDisplay
  function, overriding any navigation transformations set in a Vrui
  application's constructor.
- Fixed behavior of Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterMouse for mice with more
  than three buttons via changes in Vrui::VRWindow.

- Fixed null pointer bug when the master of a cluster rendering system
  does not have a defined HOSTNAME.
- Added methods to query widget colors to GLMotif::Widget.
- Added method to query window title to GLMotif::PopupWindow.
- Fixed catastrophic typo in makefile: used result from PNG check for
  both PNG and JPEG support, leading to build failure when only libpng
  is present on a host system.
- Fixed ray intersection instability in GLMotif::Widget: ray
  intersection result might have been invalid due to numerical round-off
  for zero-thickness widgets.
- Added EyeRayTool to set ray direction of input device to sight line
  from main viewer.
- Removed superfluous #include <vector> from GL/GLContextData.h and
  #include <GL/GLObject.h> from GL/GLContextData.cpp.

  "Desktop" for better consistency.
- Added support for stereo rendering compatible with Texas Instruments
  "3D DLP" projectors, as used in Samsung or Mitsubishi 3D TVs. Selected
  in Vrui configuration file by setting the window's windowType to
  InterleavedViewportStereo.
- Slightly improved rendering on autostereoscopic display by reading the
  number of viewing zones, and the viewport tiling layout, from the Vrui
  configuration file.
- Fixed missing initialization in Vrui::RayMenuTool.
- Added isManaged() and isVisible() methods to GLMotif::WidgetManager.

Vrui-1.0-052:
- Changed array kd-tree construction method to use std::nth_element.

  lost virtual input device back to its initial position.
- Added OrderedTuple class to Misc library to act as hash keys.
- Added UnorderedTuple class to Misc library to act as hash keys.
- GLFont class now uses alpha component in text foreground/background
  colors and uploads string textures as RGBA; enables transparent text.
- Had to remove std::nth_element from kd-tree again to get around an
  ambiguity between std::swap and Misc::swap that shouldn't even exist.
- Re-enabled std::nth_element in ArrayKdTree by not including
  Misc/Utility.h. Still no clue why Misc::swap is ambiguous with
  std::swap.
- Added explicit connect() method to Comm::UDPSocket to set/change the
  association of a UDP socket after creation.
- Added default constructors creating invalid sockets to Comm::UDPSocket
  and Comm::TCPSocket.
- Added class Comm::FdSet to simplify using the select() and pselect()
  system calls.
- Added getHeadlight() method to Vrui::Viewer; returns const reference
  to viewer's lightsource object.

  routine more easily; std::nth_element is current default.
- Added redundant element initialization in constructors for
  GLMotif::Widget and GLMotif::Arrow to get around valgrind complaints.
- Flipped matrix traversal order in Geometry::Matrix copy constructor;
  does not change anything, but might be marginally faster.

  Vrui::ComeHitherNavigationTool, is now based on fixed max velocity and
  transition distance, both in linear and angular space.
- Added ability to set and query Vrui's physical coordinate unit both in
  imperial units (inches) and metric units (meters). Added meterScale
  setting to Vrui's root configuration file section, and
  getMeterFactor() function to Vrui's kernel API.
- Added Vrui::CoordinateTransform, base class for (non-linear)
  coordinate transformations from Vrui's navigation space to "user
  interest space." Coordinate transformation objects can be registered
  with the Vrui coordinate manager, and are used by measurement tools to
  report positions in coordinates of interest to the user of an
  application, e.g., in geoid coordinates.
- Added Vrui::OrthogonalCoordinateTransform, a coordinate transformation
  class for orthogonal transformations (translations, rotations, uniform
  scalings).
- Added support for user-space coordinate transformations to
  Vrui::MeasurementTool.
- Added Vrui::GeodeticCoordinateTransform, a coordinate transformation
  class to convert from geocentric Cartesian coordinates to latitude,
  longitude, elevation geodetic coordinates on a variety of geoids.
- Finally added operators + and += to GLMotif::ZRange to calculate the
  union of two Z ranges; changed GLMotif classes to use the operators.
- Added GLMotif::Margin class, to pad a widget against resizes of its
  parent widget.
- Improved build system on Mac OS X by sorting library dependencies
  before expanding a dependency's library names.

- Added GLMotif::SingleChildContainer, a base class for container
  widgets with a single child widget.
- Changed GLMotif::Margin to be a descendant of
  GLMotif::SingleChildContainer.
- Added dirty flag and isDirty() method to Vrui::VRWindow to support new
  algorithm to handle X events and multiple windows.
- Implemented new pipe-based event handling mechanism in Vrui main loop.
  Improved reliability; multiple windows per node now work in blocking
  mode, exit from windowless master nodes finally works. Code is
  simpler, to boot. Paves the way for implementing event timers, as
  well.
- Added check for valid input devices to Vrui initialization; shuts down
  now when no valid input devices are found (used to cause segmentation
  fault).
- Made internal changes to Misc::PriorityHeap's Iterator class and
  added new method to remove arbitrary elements from a heap.
- Added first version of Misc::TimerEventScheduler, a class to
  implement application-level timer events in GLMotif and Vrui.
- Added pointer to a Misc::TimerEventScheduler to GLMotif::WidgetManager
  so that GLMotif widgets have a way to schedule and react to timer
  events.
- Added a Misc::TimerEventScheduler to Vrui's kernel state, and a method
  to retrieve a pointer to the scheduler to Vrui's kernel API.
- Added application timer event handling to Vrui's main loop.
- Added click-repeat using timer events to GLMotif::Slider.
- Primed Vrui's frame timer calculation to start with 1s per frame
  instead of 0; should fix timing problems when applications use
  Vrui::getCurrentFrameTime() during the first few frames.
- Added synchronization function to Vrui's private API to allow a
  playback input device adapter to synchronize the sequence of Vrui
  frames exactly to its saved input device data.
- Added quitWhenDone flag to Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterPlayback to shut
  down the Vrui application when the end of input data is reached.
- Added synchronizePlayback flag to Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterPlayback
  to replicate the timing of the saved input data as closely as
  possible.
- Added Vrui/PrintInputDeviceDataFile.cpp, a utility program to dump
  input device data files in the format used by Vrui's playback input
  device adapter as human-readable text.
- Added a setting to throttle the frame rate of Vrui's main loop, mainly
  to reduce the amount of input device data written to file while
  recording a session, and to give the playback adapter breathing room
  to synchronize playback to recording even if the playback system is
  slower.
- Added requestScreenshot() method to Vrui::VRWindow to support movie
  export from within a playback input device adapter.
- Added movie export facility to playback input device adapter; users
  can specify a filename template for the resulting frames, and an
  export frame rate. The exporter will take great care to take
  screenshots at exactly the right times, even if Vrui's frame rate
  varies.
- Added new constructor to Geometry::Polygon class that creates a vertex
  array but does not initialize or copy the vertices.
- Added special handling for C escape sequences to
  Misc::ValueCoder<std::string>. Recognizes all C escape characters
  except octal and hexadecimal character codes.
- Fixed typo (signal instead of broadcast) in Threads::MutexCond.
- Improved handling of locks in Threads::MutexCond.
- Created new low-level sound library, primarily to support built-in
  recording and playback of audio commentary with Vrui's input device
  data saver and playback input device adapters.
- Made small improvements to Vrui build system.
- Brought Vrui HTML documentation up to date.
- Changed initialization of input device data saver in Vrui
  configuration file; settings for Vrui::InputDeviceDataSaver now read
  from its own separate configuration file section.
- Added automatic sound recording to Vrui::InputDeviceDataSaver.
- Added automatic sound playback to Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterPlayback.
- Added methods to create screens programmatically to Vrui::VRScreen.
- Added methods to create viewers programmatically to Vrui::Viewer.
- Added methods to override VR window's screen and viewer to
  Vrui::VRWindow.
- Created ScreenshotTool to take screenshots from inside immersive
  environments by using a virtual camera that overrides the screen and
  viewer of a selected window on the master node.
- Changed ALSA sound code in Sound::SoundRecorder and Sound::SoundPlayer
  to use older API version for backwards compatibility.
- Added forwarding VR device driver module to connect to VRPN servers.
  Initial version works with the VRPN streaming server in OptiTrack's
  rigid body toolkit, but has not been tested with any other VRPN
  servers due to lack of access.
- Disabled mouse events in VR windows when no mouse input device adapter
  is requested.
- Changed Vrui initialization order: Vrui's system menu is created after
  vislets and their parameters have been read from command line.
- Added active flag and activation methods to Vrui::Vislet base class.
- Added vislet submenu to Vrui's system menu to enable / disable vislets
  individually at run-time.
- Added enabling/disabling animation to Vrui CAVERenderer vislet.
- Fixed serious flaw in Comm::FdSet: file descriptor sets are now
  cleared if select or pselect are interrupted before any events occur.
- Behavior change in Realtime::AlarmTimer: Used to be that a non-expired
  timer could not be reset by arming it again; that was stupid. Now
  arming an already armed timer will reset its expiration time.
  armTimer() still returns false if the timer could not be armed for
  whatever reason.
- Added VR device driver for Nintendo Wii controller to distribution;
  gets built when the FindLibrary.sh scripts detects a user-level
  Bluetooth library in either /usr or /usr/local.
- DeviceTest no longer prints any tracking information if no trackers
  are present.
- Vrui screenshot tool now keeps virtual screen and main viewer
  orthogonal to always create on-axis screenshots; what you see through
  the frame is exactly what you get.
- Removed pad flag from GLMotif::Margin class and added independent
  horizontal and vertical stretching modes.
- Added click-repeat behavior to GLMotif::ScrollBar.
- Increased click-repeat speed for GLMotif::Slider and
  GLMotif::ScrollBar to 0.5s for first repeat, then 0.1s.
- Fixed two serious bugs in Vrui kernel: 1: slave nodes must not test
  Vrui event pipe (it only exists on master); 2: slave nodes must
  always run in continuous update mode (they always block on master
  node update).
- Added -rootSection option to VRDeviceDaemon to specify which
  configuration file section to use.
- Added option to flip Z components of positions to VRPNClient VR device
  driver module to fix left-handed coordinate systems on the server
  side.
- Added flag to enable interactive resizing to GLMotif::PopupWindow. If
  enabled (currently the default for testing), users can resize windows
  by dragging their borders.
- Split GLMotif::ListBox widget into two parts: basic list box without
  scroll bars, and ScrolledListBox compound widget to implement basic
  scrolling behavior.
- Created helper GLMotif::Alignment structure to store horizontal and
  vertical alignments for objects inside larger frames.
- Changed API of GLMotif::Margin to use new GLMotif::Alignment
  structure.
- Added per-row and per-column expansion weights and grid alignment to
  GLMotif::RowColumn class. Default behavior identical to previous
  version.
- Created compound GLMotif::ScrolledListBox class.
- Added getChildRow() and getChildColumn() methods to
  GLMotif::RowColumn.
- Updated Vrui configuration file to simplify the steps required to get
  a desktop input device such as a space ball to work.
- Did some updates and fixes in the Vrui HTML documentation.
- Added method to remove an entire row or column (for vertical or
  horizontal orientations, respectively) of widgets from to
  GLMotif::RowColumn.
- Added setTime() and getTime() methods to GLMotif::WidgetManager to
  allow widgets to implement time-dependent behavior in a portable and
  cluster-compatible manner.
- Added double-click behavior to GLMotif::ListBox; double click timeout
  currently hardcoded to 0.25 seconds.
- Added getBorderType() method to GLMotif::Widget.
- Added methods to get/set the armed background color to GLMotif::Button
  and made it safe to change a button's background color while armed.
- Made most set... methods of GLMotif::Widget virtual.
- Added methods to query the number of list items and to add another
  list item to GLMotif::DropdownBox.
- Added methods to query margin width and spacing to GLMotif::RowColumn.
- Added a standard file selection dialog to GLMotif.
- Added deleteWidget() method to GLMotif::WidgetManager to safely delete
  widgets even when called from inside a callback reacting to the same
  widget.
- "Load View" button in Vrui system menu now brings up a file selection
  dialog to select a previously saved viewpoint file.
- Added class GLMotif::Separator to visually separate adjacent
  components in widget layouts.
- Split resizing flag in GLMotif::PopupWindow to separately toggle
  horizontal and vertical resizing.
- Improved layout of Vrui measurement tool dialog.
- Changed default alignment of GLMotif::Label to left.
- Changed default alignment of GLMotif radio button toggles to left.
- Changed default menu entry border width to zero in
  GLMotif::StyleSheet.
- Made GLMotif::FileSelectionDialog cluster-aware to work in the
  presence of differing file systems on master and slave nodes.
- Added new dependency for Comm library to GLMotif (incurred by cluster-
  awareness in GLMotif::FileSelectionDialog).
- Added code to synchronize changes to Vrui's navigation transformation
  and/or display center or size across clusters, mainly to allow panning
  and navigating windows on the master node of a cluster.
- Changed Vrui to load viewpoint file only on master node; automatic
  synchronization takes care of rest of cluster.
- Created Misc::StringMarshaller class to simplify sending strings
  across pipes represented by classes that support typed templatized
  reads and writes.
- Added methods to send and retrieve entire configuration files across
  arbitrary pipes supporting typed templatized read and write methods.
- Changed Vrui initialization code to send the Vrui configuration file
  from the master node to all slave nodes to get around problem of
  mismatching configuration files.
- Changed Vrui build system to better deal with missing OpenAL library
  on host system.
- Fixed code opening configuration file in VRDeviceDaemon to work with
  the updated Misc::ConfigurationFile class.
- Moved tool kill zone in default desktop configuration to lower-left
  corner of window to make life easier for Mac users.
- Slightly improved "interleaved viewport" stereo rendering mode (for 3D
  TVs) by using only a single framebuffer object and off-screen
  rendering pass.
- Added pseudo target to print configuration options to makefile.
- Added template configuration file section for Nintendo Wii controller
  to VRDevices.cfg.
- Added ability to define device glyphs to
  Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterPlayback.
- Inserted missing semicolon after class declaration of
  Misc::RefCounted.
- Fixed broken type conversions in Misc::Autopointer.
- Added missing #include <stdlib.h> to Misc/FileLocator.cpp. For some
  reason, this never caused an error.
- Fixed z axis flipping in VRDeviceDaemon/VRPNConnection.cpp; now
  properly flips orientation.
- Added missing include file string.h to VRDeviceDaemon/VRFactory.cpp.
- Adapted all templatized classes to conform to g++ 4.3.x's
  interpretation of the C++ standard.

Vrui-1.0-054:
- Added missing #include <string.h> to Misc/MemMappedFile.h.
- Fixed missing button initialization in
  VRDeviceDaemon/VRDeviceManager.cpp.
- Temporarily disabled position/orientation sanity checking in
  VRDeviceDaemon/VRPNClient.cpp.
- Added function canReadImageFileType to Images/ReadImageFile.h to check
  whether the readImageFile function supports the image's file type.
- Added hack to VRDeviceDaemon/VRFactory.cpp to get around compiler
  warnings for function pointers from DSOs.
- Added transposed matrix multiplication methods (from right and left)
  to class Geometry::Matrix.
- Fixed bug in DeviceTest: Didn't print valuator data when no trackers
  are present.
- Added templatized image file reader class for IFF image files.
- Added existing templatized image file reader classes to makefile.
- Added method to compile shaders from strings to class GLShader.
- Added methods to rotate and/or scale around a given pivot point to
  transformation classes in namespace Geometry.
- Added method to query the exact length of the last frame to Vrui
  kernel interface.
- Improved axis converters in HIDDevice VRDeviceDaemon module; can now
  easily invert axis direction and map axes to half-valuators.
- Fixed scaling pivot bug in DesktopDeviceNavigationTool.
- Fixed bug in error recovery in Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterIndexMap; now
  fails with proper error message if input devices are misconfigured.
- Added prototype of "revolver tool" to map multiple virtual buttons to
  a pair of input device buttons (action button, revolve button).
- Made ALSA requirement in Sound library optional; sound recording /
  playback will silently fail under Linux if the ALSA development
  packages are not installed on the host system.

Vrui-1.0-055:
- Improved picking algorithm and increased button size in
  Vrui::VirtualInputDevice to simplify interacting with virtual input
  devices especially in fully-immersive VR environments.
- Re-enabled position/orientation sanity checks in VRPNClient VR device
  driver module.
- Removed several warnings when compiling with g++ 4.3.2.
- Added revolver tool to list of Vrui tools in makefile; leftover bug
  from previous version. Caused failure to run any Vrui application.

Vrui-1.0-056:
- Provided several device access convenience functions in Vrui::Tool to
  slightly simplify tool development. Changed existing tool classes to
  use new convenience functions where appropriate.
- Moved handling of eye ray vs device ray into Vrui::UserInterfaceTool
  base class to get uniform behavior between all user interface tool
  classes.
- Removed warning messages when compiling with g++ 4.3.x from
  VRDeviceDaemon modules.
- Removed all warnings but one tough one from main Vrui when compiling
  with g++ 4.3.2.
- Overhauled A.R.T. DTrack VR device driver module to deal with the
  flexibility of new wireless DTrack devices (that can now have buttons
  and/or valuators), and the ASCII data format that is required to get
  button and valuator information. Stupidly, A.R.T. doesn't provide a
  binary format to get at the new bits. And, they obsoleted the Euler
  angle format in favor of full 3x3 matrices, the idiots.
- Added image file reader classes to makefile installation.
- Fixed bugs in Images::PNMImageFileReader and added it to makefile.
- Fixed CAVERenderer vislet so that it does actually turn viewers'
  headlights on/off as needed.
- Added methods to Vrui::ToolManager to query whether a given button or
  valuator on a given device has a "real" tool assigned (as opposed to a
  tool selection tool).
- Improved Vrui TransformTool base class to disable derived classes'
  transformation when an unassigned button is pressed, so that
  transformation does not interfere with tool selection.
- Fixed OpenGL state bug in Vrui::JediTool; now works properly with
  interleaved stereo on 3D TVs.
- Added multithreaded tree generation to Geometry::ArrayKdTree class.
  Uses only naive parallelization, but realizes decent speed-ups on
  large point sets.
- Added ScaleNavigationTool to be able to implement
  WandNavigationTool's navigation method using two independent buttons.
- Changed Vrui initialization to try both HOSTNAME and HOST (in that
  order) to determine the default root section name.
- API change in Geometry::Box: declared min and max public and removed
  all getMin / getMax accessor functions. Rationale: min and max have
  no invariants, and are not an implementation detail.
- Added missing error checking to array-based write() methods in
  Misc::File and Misc::LargeFile. Now throws a write error if the total
  number of bytes actually written does not match the expected number.
- Minor cleanup in Vrui initialization to improve robustness.
- Fixed error check in Misc::File and Misc::LargeFile.
- Added Misc/FileNameExtensions containing several helper functions to
  extract and match extensions from path / file names; might get
  extended to do additional file name processing in the future.
- Changed Sound::SoundPlayer and Sound::SoundRecorder to use new file
  name extension helper functions.
- Added new flags to Vrui::ValuatorFlyTurnNavigationTool to switch
  between flying/rotating in physical space vs device space. Settings
  default to all points / vectors given in device space.
- Overhauled Threads::TripleBuffer class; now it's actually useful!
- Added read/write buffering to Comm::TCPPipe, which greatly increases
  performance. Important: do no longer enable TCP corking on
  Comm::TCPPipe since it interferes with the new, better stream handling
  algorithm. To be safe, Comm::TCPPipe overrides setCork(bool) with a
  dummy method.
- Changed Comm::ClusterPipe class in the same way as Comm::TCPPipe. Now
  uses read/write buffers on the cluster's master node, and preemptively
  forwards data from master node to slave nodes on reads. Makes explicit
  flushRead() method obsolete, which is a Very Good Thing.
- Changed API of Comm::ClusterPipe: flushRead was made obsolete by
  latest change and is now gone; flushWrite was renamed to flush to make
  the ClusterPipe API template-compatible with the Comm::TCPPipe API.
- Added proper handling of getPeerPortId, getPeerAddress, and
  getPeerHostname to Comm::ClusterPipe. Change implies that these
  functions have to be called by all cluster nodes synchronously.
- Added initial support for gathering operations to Comm::MulticastPipe.
  A gathering operation collects values from all nodes (master and
  slaves) in a multicast pipe, and applies a selected accumulation
  operation on all values. The result of that accumulation is shared
  with all nodes. Implies a barrier.
- Added Comm/GatheringOperation.h, containing a class defining the valid
  gathering operations as opcodes.
- Fixed one-off bug in Math::randUniformCC(int min,int max); now all
  values in the integer range [min, max] (both inclusive) have the same
  probability. Math::randUniformCC(min,max) is thus synonymous with
  Math::randUniformCO(min,max+1).
- Added Misc/StringHashFunctions.h, defining a specialization of
  Misc::StandardHashFunction for std::string, and a new
  Misc::StringHashFunction class for C strings.
- Added ConstIterator class to Misc::HashTable.
- Added conservative intersection tests for axis-aligned boxes and
  spheres to GLFrustum class.
- Added OpenGL extension classes for GL_ARB_geometry_shader4 and
  GL_EXT_geometry_shader4 (original code supplied by Tony Bernardin).
- Added GLGeometryShader class to allow linking GLSL geometry shaders
  into shader programs. Implemented as a child class of GLShader to get
  around weighing down the latter with as-yet not widely supported
  geometry shader baggage (original code supplied by Tony Bernardin).
- Added readRaw method to Comm::TCPPipe. Shadows Comm::TCPSocket's
  read method; blocks until at least a single byte is available, and
  then returns as much data as is currently available up to the request
  size.
- Added getBufferSize method to Comm::TCPPipe to query the size of the
  internal read/write buffers. Good for efficient data forwarding while
  still enjoying the benefits of buffered typed read/writes.
- Added readRaw and getBufferSize methods to Comm::ClusterPipe to mirror
  Comm::TCPPipe.
- Improved handling of plug-in install paths (Tools, Vislets, VRDevices,
  VRCalibrators) in makefile and fixed wrong path in generated Vrui
  makefile fragment.
- Upped precision in default conversion for Misc::ValueCoder
  specializations for float and double values. Floats are now printed
  with 7, and doubles with 14 significant digits.
- Added global sleep() function to Misc/Time.h.
- Added error handling to destructors of Comm::TCPPipe and
  Comm::ClusterPipe. Problem was that the implicit flush operation
  would throw another exception if a pipe was destroyed in response to
  a previous pipe error. Now the destructors make a best-effort attempt
  to flush and fail silently in case of errors.
- Added VRUI_LIBDIR variable to Vrui makefile fragment to simplify
  developing higher-level libraries to install with Vrui itself.
- Renamed PACKAGEROOT in all build system files to VRUIPACKAGEROOT to
  simplify developing higher-level libraries based on Vrui.

Vrui-1.0-057:
- Fixed stupidest copypasta error ever: created GLARBGeometryShader4
  OpenGL extension class from GLEXTGeometryShader4, and replaced EXT by
  ARB. Result: TEXTURE became TARBURE.
- Added abstraction class for ALSA PCM devices to Sound library.
- Changed Sound::SoundRecorder and Sound::SoundPlayer to use the ALSA
  PCM device abstraction class.
- Added convenience function to set "standard" sample formats to
  Sound::SoundDataFormat.

Vrui-1.0-058:
- Fixed slight typo in Realtime::AlarmTimer, didn't have an actual bad
  effect since it was an alias from struct siginfo to its typedef
  siginfo_t.
- Removed obsolete tool classes JoystickNavigationTool and
  SpaceBallNavigationTool -- functionality of both has been generalized
  by DesktopDeviceNavigationTool for a long time.
- Added new base tool class PointingTool for tools used to point out
  features or locations in a 3D environment.
- Moved InputDeviceTool base class into Vrui library itself.
- Replaced obsolete SpaceBallTool with new DesktopDeviceTool; has same
  functionality as DesktopDeviceNavigationTool, minus the navigation
  part.
- Moved LaserpointerTool, JediTool and FlashlightTool Vrui tool classes
  to be derived from PointingTool.
- Added getName() method to all tool classes to allow returning a
  descriptive tool name for menus and other user-facing lists as
  replacement for the somewhat unreadable tool class name.
- Changed default settings of many Vrui tool classes to the settings
  most often used in actual environments; cleaned up Vrui configuration
  file by removing default settings.
- Removed sections for dead IDAV VR environments from Vrui configuration
  file: Immersive Workbench, non-stereoscopic Powerwall.
- Changed constructor of GLMotif::FileSelectionDialog: can now take
  comma-separated list of individual file name filters which will make
  up individual entries in the drop-down box.
- Changed addFileNameFilters method in GLMotif::FileSelectionDialog: can
  now take comma-separated list of filters just like constructor.
- Changed Vrui's ViewpointFileNavigationTool: if no curve file name is
  specified in the Vrui configuration file, the tool will pop up a file
  selection dialog to load a curve file on creation.
- Added VRUI_VERSION variable to Vrui makefile fragment so that
  dependent software can warn users about requirement violations -- or
  to allow dependent software to adapt.
- Added new argument to Vrui::GenericToolFactory constructor to set a
  display name for the described tool class.
- Added dependency on PTHREADS to MYGEOMETRY in BuildRoot/Packages;
  became necessary due to new multithreaded kd-tree generation method.
- Consolidated extensions of files generated by Vrui:
  .view: Binary environment-independent viewpoint file
  .views: ASCII environment-independent multi-viewpoint file (generated
          by ViewpointFileSaverTool to use as animation keyframes)
  .curve: Cubic spline curve generated by CurveEditorTool, to use as
          viewpoint animation curve
- Changed ViewpointFileNavigationTool to read either a .views file and
  auto-generated a C^2-continuous spline curve, or read a .curve file
  and use the contained spline unchanged.
- Fixed another copypasta bug in GL/Extensions/GLARBGeometryShader4.h.
- Added a non-const getEntry() method to Misc::HashTable which allows
  modifying the value of the returned hash table key/value pair.
- Added parametrization by element type to Misc::OrderedType and
  Misc::UnorderedTuple.
- Fixed long-standing makefile bug in the part that creates a runwithx
  script for pre-Leopard Mac OS X, somehow nobody complained until just
  now. The script is obsolete anyways since Leopard auto-starts X when
  running an X application. Yay!
- Removed set() method from Misc::UnorderedTuple, because it was an API
  failure -- the tuple would be re-sorted after every set(), causing a
  sequence of set() operations to create a tuple incrementally to fail
  in the weirdest ways. Unordered tuples can only be set atomically.
- Added class Misc::ASCIIFileReader to efficiently read from ASCII input
  files. Supports on-the-fly gunzipping, and memory-mapped file I/O.
- Added dependency on ZLIB to Misc library to support on-the-fly
  gunzipping in Misc::ASCIIFileReader.
- Added Threads::ASCIIFileReader class to mirror the behavior of
  Misc::ASCIIFileReader. Uses a background thread to read ahead in the
  input file, hopefully maximizing throughput.
- This now creates an actual libThreads library file; updated
  BuildRoot/Packages to reflect that.
- Added Threads::RingBuffer class to support in-memory pipes between a
  producer thread and a consumer thread.
- Added Threads::DropoutBuffer class as a generalization of the triple
  buffer communication pattern. The buffer retains up to a preset
  number of most recent elements for a consumer to read.
- Changed Misc::ConfigurationFile API: Added methods to create empty
  configuration file to simplify client code; changed load() method to
  take a file name as argument; added reload() method replacing the old
  load() method.
- Added Misc/FunctionCalls.h containing a first attempt at representing
  function calls or method invocations as first-class variables.
- Changed destruction behavior of GLMotif::Popup and
  GLMotif::PopupWindow. Top-level widgets now automatically unmanage
  themselves (pop down) when they are destroyed.
- Changed behavior of GLMotif::ListBox: if the selected item is removed,
  the next item will be selected, or the previous one at the end of the
  list.
- Created Vrui::DisplayState, a helper class to query per-display Vrui
  rendering state (window/screen/viewer, eye position, etc.) from within
  a display method during rendering. Stand-in until a real solution
  turns up at some point in the future.
- Added new getDisplayState() function to Vrui kernel API, which can be
  called from inside a display method and returns Vrui display state
  valid for that particular method invocation.
- Fixed a couple of bugs pointed out by Ed Puckett:
  - = instead of == in Geometry::HVector::isVector().
	- Missing cast to char* in Misc::PriorityHeap::~PriorityHeap().
	- Missing include Geometry/Vector.h in Vrui/VirtualInputDevice.h.
	- Missing include Geometry/Point.h, Geometry/Ray.h, and
    Vrui/Geometry.h in Vrui/VRWindow.h.
- Added floating-point classification functions to Math/Math.h in order
  to deprecate the use of the is...() macros in math.h.
- Reorganized code in Math/Math.h a little.
- Changed code in Geometry/Rotation.h to use the Math::isNan function
  instead of the isnan() macro.
- Changed code in Vrui/Tools/DenseMatrix.cpp to use the Math::isNan
  function.
- Removed dangerous assert() calls from Vrui/Tools/DenseMatrix.cpp.

  CharacterSource, FileCharacterSource, GzippedFileCharacterSource,
  TokenSource.
- Added new high-performance ASCII file reader class to Comm library:
  ClusterFileCharacterSource.
- Added experimental header file Comm/Clusterize.h with helper functions
  to distribute an application over a cluster, and initialize
  communication using a Comm::MulticastPipeMultiplexer.
- Fixed bug in vislet parameter list processing (pointed out by Ed
  Puckett).
- Added Misc/StringPrintf.h defining a function to print into a C++
  string using a printf-style interface.
- Changed handling of modelview matrices in Vrui OpenGL display code to
  reduce effects of OpenGL's single-precision floating-point format on
  rendering accuracy when displaying small objects far away from the
  global coordinate system's origin. Detail changes:
  - Added state to store full modelview matrices for physical and
    navigational coordinates to Vrui::DisplayState.
  - Changed Vrui::VRWindow to compute full modelview matrices for both
    spaces and store them in the window's DisplayState object.
  - Changed Vrui's main display method to use the modelview matrices
    stored by VRWindow.
  - Changed Vrui::LightsourceManager to use modelview matrices from
    DisplayState object when setting navigational light sources.
  - Changed Vrui's MeasurementTool to use modelview matrices from
    DisplayState object when displaying markers for measurements in
    navigational coordinates.
  - Changed Vrui's CurveEditorTool to use modelview matrices in
    DisplayState object.

Vrui-1.0-059:
- Added GLGeometry::Vertex, an analogon to GLVertex using geometry
  types from the geometry library.
- Added dependency on Vrui dynamic library to all Vrui tools and vislets
  to enable using them from a program not linked with -rdynamic, such as
  for example a Python run-time environment.

Vrui-1.0-060:
- Fixed type problem in GLGeometry::Vertex; Position in one specialized
  type was defined as a vector.
- Created Vrui::MouseSurfaceNavigationTool, a tool class for easy
  navigation on DEMs and virtual globes. Interacts with applications via
  an align() callback function that limits the tool's local navigation
  frame to an application-defined surface.
- Started changing include file order in some sources; new style is to
  include Foo.h from Foo.cpp before any other headers, to simplify
  finding missing include files in headers.
- Added Geometry::Geoid class, to bundle all that nasty math to convert
  between different geodesic coordinate systems in one handy place.
- Added convenience creation functions to Misc/FunctionCalls.h, but
  admittedly, they're not all that convenient.
- Created Vrui::WalkSurfaceNavigationTool, a navigation tool that uses a
  walking metaphor to navigate along an application-defined surface.
- Added new method loadToolBinding to Vrui::ToolManager, to allow Vrui
  or applications to load tool bindings on demand, using the same
  configuration method as for the default bindings listed in toolNames.
- Added three new command line options to Vrui:
  - -mergeConfig <configuration file name>
    Merges another configuration file into Vrui's configuration. Options
    are processed in order, after the global and user configuration
    files have already been merged.
  - -addToolClass <tool class name>
    Adds a tool class to the list of available tools, just like adding
    <tool class name> to the toolClassNames configuration file setting.
  - -addTool <tool binding section name>
    Adds a tool binding to the list of default tools, just like adding
    <tool binding section name> to the toolNames configuration file
    setting.
- Overhauled error messages during Vrui's initialization; particularly,
  added more detail to tool binding errors to aid in configuration file
  debugging.

Vrui-1.0-061:
- Added "navigation mode" to virtual input devices, which can be toggled
  with a new button rendered underneath the input device's glyph. In
  navigation mode, the input device will move with the navigation
  transformation, and in effect act as an application-level dragger.
- Changed handling of Vrui's navigation transformation: during
  initialization, particularly from inside an application's constructor,
  changes to the navigation transformation take effect right away.
  Starting with the initDisplay() call, changes are delayed to the next
  frame as before.
- Added default tool factory destructor method to Vrui::ToolManager; can
  be used by applications to delete their custom tool factories.
- Added base class for application-specific tools to Vrui::Application,
  greatly reduces the amount of code necessary to create and manage tool
  classes that need to refer back to the application object owning them.
- Changes VruiCustomToolDemo example program to use the new tool base
  class from Vrui::Application.
- Added basic standard output operators for geometry classes in
  Geometry/OutputOperators.h.
- Added missing #include <stdio.h> in some files; were not noticed
  before g++ 4.4.0.
- Added encoder and decoder classes for geometry matrices and affine and
  projective transformations to Geometry/GeometryValueCoders.
- Added support for off-axis projectors to Vrui screen and window
  management, controlled by specifying an optional homography matrix in
  a screen's configuration file section. 3x3 homographies are extended
  to 3D and applied to the OpenGL projection matrix before the frustum
  projection.
  - Added offAxis flag and homography matrix to Vrui::VRScreen.
  - Added boolean offAxis setting and 3x3 matrix homography setting to
    screens' recognized configuration file settings.
  - Changed Vrui::VRWindow to apply homography matrix for off-axis
    screens when creating a window's projection matrix.
  - Changed Vrui::VRWindow to apply homography matrix for off-axis
    screens when reprojecting a window position into model space.
- Changed Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterMouse such that modifier keys also
  apply to the mouse wheel valuator.
- Changed Misc::ConfigurationFile to ignore comments and whitespace at
  the end of lines read from a configuration file; paves the way for
  some simplifications in the future. No more quotes around section
  names starting in the next release.
- Fixed a problem with Sound library: SOUND_USE_ALSA was only defined
  while building the library itself, not client code depending on it.
  Added -DSOUND_USE_ALSA to MYSOUND_CFLAGS in BuildRoot/Packages.
- Fixed stupid bug in MouseSurfaceNavigationTool's widget dragging
  behavior; now works as it should.
- Added helper class Vrui::MouseCursorFaker to render a fake mouse
  cursor in cases where there is no hardware cursor, or it is
  inappropriate.
- Changed Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterMouse to render a fake mouse cursor if
  requested.
- Changed Vrui::InputDeviceAdapterPlayback to render a fake mouse cursor
  if requested.
- Removed option to render fake mouse cursors from diverse mouse
  navigation tools.
- Added virtual compass to Vrui::MouseSurfaceNavigationTool.

Vrui-1.0-062:
- Fixed up cosmetics in Vrui::MouseSurfaceNavigationTool's virtual
  compass.

    selection mode after construction.
  - Added new callbacks and callback data classes.
  - Added new methods to query and change set of selected list items.
- Changed constructor of GLMotif::ScrolledListBox to take selection mode
  argument.
- Changed GLMotif::FileSelectionBox to use new ListBox API.
- Added temporary guard against using direct calls to floating-point
  number classification functions (isnan etc.) on Mac OS X, until I
  figure out what the hell Apple broke now.

Vrui-1.0-063:
- Added definitions for static constant data members to template classes
  in Math and Geometry libraries to simplify the life of people who want
  to use them with non-C++ user code.
- Fixed some problems in template friend function instantiations for
  same reason.
- Added Misc::ValueSource, a class to read strings or numbers from ASCII
  files represented by CharacterSource objects. Obsoletes the various
  versions of ASCIIFileReader.

- Added class Misc::XBaseTable to read from database tables in XBase
  (dBASE III, FoxPro, Clipper,...) format.
- Changed makefile to use relative paths when creating symbolic links
  for generated libraries (suggested by Jordan Van Aalsburg).
- Changed makefile to remove generated Vrui makefile fragment's
  dependency on makefile itself; probably not dangerous, but simplifies
  building Vrui for one installation directory, and then temporarily
  installing it elsewhere (to create an RPM or Debian package, for
  example).
- Changed implementation of Misc::TokenSource to be more in line with
  Misc::ValueSource.
- Added skipString() method to Misc::ValueSource.
- Changed VruiCustomToolDemo example program; added clarification that
  the custom tool class requires two buttons to bind.

  sources with navigational light sources if both were defined.
- Fixed base class initialization bug in Vrui:FlashlightTool.
- Added Vrui::ClipPlaneTool to interactively add clipping planes to an
  environment.
- Fixed bug in Vrui::Application; application object's tool manager
  callbacks are now installed from inside the constructor as opposed to
  from inside the run() method, to catch creation of application-
  specific tools from within an application's constructor.
- Added getBuffer method to Threads::TripleBuffer to provide a low-level
  access point to the buffer values bypassing the locking scheme.
- Added new class GLMotif::NewButton to move towards a new and improved
  inheritance tree for button widgets. New button widget is a container
  that can pop in/out arbitrary child widgets. Contains convenience
  constructors to create "blind" buttons and label buttons.
- Added Threads::GzippedFileCharacterSource, a class to read gzip-
  compressed files with readahead and background decompression.

  Vrui::DesktopDeviceTool and Vrui::DesktopDeviceNavigationTool to
  allow advertising the tool classes without specific configuration
  sections.

  TCP sockets. Does not currently include code to detect end-of-file
  conditions arising when the remote socket disconnects, 'cuz that's
  kinda hard.
- Defined a file name insert for OS-specific implementations of cross-
  platform classes as OSSPECFILEINSERT in BuildRoot/SystemDefinitions.
  Defaults to Linux on Linux and MacOSX on Mac OSX.
- Changed makefile to always enable support for OpenAL when building

- Added class GLString to associate data with C-style strings that is
  required to draw such strings using texture-based fonts.
- Added class GLLabel to simplify drawing labels using texture-based

- Added sound() method to Vrui::Vislet to render OpenAL spatial sound.
- Added sound() method to Vrui::VisletManager to call the sound()
  methods of all active vislets.

	Vrui.makeinclude if Vrui was compiled with OpenAL spatial sound
  support.
- Fixed Vrui::TransformTool to reset virtual device pointer to zero
  after destroying device (not really necessary, but better).
- Added virtual input device shadowing the zoom button to
  Vrui::WandNavigationTool, so that the zoom button can have a second
  function while the navigation tool is inactive.
- Removed deprecated features from Vrui initialization sequence to bring
  application behavior in line with vislet behavior and increase
  flexibility.
  - startDisplay() and startSound() functions no longer exposed to

    removed in favor of the GLObject / ALObject mechanism.
  - useSound() method in Vrui::Application has been removed.
  - Sound processing can now be requested by any entity by calling

    mainLoop() is called.
- Changed GLMotif::RadioBox to optimize the sequence of operations when
  a new button is added to a radio box.
- Added update() method to GLMotif::Widget which is used by a widget
  to notify its parent that its visual representation has changed, to
  invalidate any render caching performed by the parent.
- Changed code of most GLMotif widget classes to guarantee that update()
  is called on any changes to the visual representations of widgets.
- Implemented render caching for GLMotif::PopupWindow, but alas, it
  decreases performance. Disabled for now; need to test on other
  architectures and environments.
- Added subclass DeferredRenderer to GLLabel class to collect label
  objects during a rendering pass and render them later en-bloc to
  minimize OpenGL state change penalties.

  after reading.
- Fixed small bug in Comm::MulticastPipeMultiplexer that wouldn't close
  the socket on some initialization failures.
- Improved Vrui calibration utilities to work better with NaturalPoint
  OptiTrack systems:
  - MeasureEnvironment can collect ball positions directly from a
    running OptiTrack Rigid Body Toolkit or Tracking Tools application.
  - AlignTrackingMarkers can query rigid body definitions directly from
    a running OptiTrack Rigid Body Toolkit or Tracking Tools
    application.
  - All calibration applications recognize a flipZ flag to enable
    changing a left-handed into a right-handed coordinate system (was
    default behavior before).
- Removed AlignTrackingMarkers from main Vrui makefile as it is now
  part of the separate Calibration package.
- Improved VRPNClient VRDeviceDaemon module to send state updates after
  each received VRPN packet, even if not all trackers were updated, and
  to process multiple protocol messages that arrive over the TCP socket
  en bloc.
- Fixed makefile for installations that do not have OpenAL support.
- Fixed makefile in ExamplePrograms.
